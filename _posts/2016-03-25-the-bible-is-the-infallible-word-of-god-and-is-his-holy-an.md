## What We Believe:  

• The Bible is the infallible Word of God and is His holy and inspired Word.

• There is one God, in which exists three persons --- the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. This is a mystery and cannot be understood but must be accepted through faith.

• Jesus Christ is the son of God made flesh. He was born of the Virgin Mary and led a sinless life. As the sacrifice on our behalf, He took upon himself all of our sins, died on the cross and rose again, providing for our eternal salvation. He ascended into Heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father, where he serves as our mediator and advocate until He comes again.

• All men and women are sinners and thus are separated and face judgment from God unless they repent of their sins and acknowledge Jesus Christ as their savior.

• We, as Christians, are called to holy living through submission to our Lord. We are to be a light unto the world and as such are called upon to address the physical, mental and spiritual needs of our fellow men and women.

• We are called as Christ's disciples to share the Good News with all the world regardless of race, color, creed or religion. We are to work tirelessly upon our Lord's behalf, heeding His calling and helping to accomplish His mission and purpose in our lives.
