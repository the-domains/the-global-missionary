description: 'Located in Kathmandu, Nepal, our Bible training center is preparing young men and women to share the Gospel in Nepal, where Christianity accounts for less than one percent of the population. Travel outside Kathmandu, the country’s capital, and you quickly arrive at unreached territories where families and individuals are waiting to hear the Good News. Through this training at our Bible school, we’re impacting thousands upon thousands of lost Nepalis.'
